# Malware Sample Tests

These servers are to be used with a sample of malware that acts as a DDoS slave. 
These take control of the slave and allow one to issue commands. Included is also 
a sample victim server to test the attack.

The scripts were created after efforts of reverse engineering.

The malware sample is not provided.
